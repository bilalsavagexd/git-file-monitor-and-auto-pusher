# Git File Monitor and Auto-pusher

A bash script that monitors specified files or directories for changes and automatically commits and pushes them to a Git repository. It also provides email notifications to collaborators when changes are detected.

## Features

- Real-time file/directory monitoring
- Automatic git commit and push on changes
- Email notifications via SendGrid
- Error handling and logging
- Support for multiple collaborators
- Configurable monitoring intervals

## Prerequisites

- Git installed and configured
- Bash shell environment
- SendGrid account (for email notifications)
- curl installed (for API requests)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/bilalsavagexd/git-file-monitor-and-auto-pusher.git
cd git-file-monitor-and-auto-pusher
```

2. Make the script executable:
```bash
chmod +x monitor_and_push.sh
```

3. Copy the sample configuration file:
```bash
cp config.cfg.example config.cfg
```

## Configuration

Edit `config.cfg` with your specific settings:

```bash
# Path to the local repository
REPO_PATH="/path/to/your/repository"

# File or directory to monitor
MONITOR_PATH="/path/to/monitor"

# Git remote and branch name
GIT_REMOTE="origin"
GIT_BRANCH="main"

# List of collaborators' email addresses
COLLABORATOR_EMAILS=("user1@example.com" "user2@example.com")

# SendGrid API credentials
SENDGRID_API_KEY="your_sendgrid_api_key"
SENDER_EMAIL="your_sender@email.com"
```

### Important Notes:
- Use forward slashes (/) in paths, even on Windows
- Ensure all paths are absolute
- Make sure the SendGrid API key has "Mail Send" permissions
- Keep your API keys secure and never commit them to the repository

## Usage

1. Start the monitoring script:
```bash
./monitor_and_push.sh
```

2. The script will:
   - Calculate initial checksums of monitored files
   - Watch for changes every 60 seconds
   - Automatically commit and push changes when detected
   - Send email notifications to listed collaborators

To stop monitoring, press `Ctrl+C`.

## Error Handling

The script includes error handling for common scenarios:
- Invalid paths
- Git repository issues
- Network connectivity problems
- Email sending failures

Errors are logged to the console and attempted to be sent via email to collaborators.

## Security Considerations

1. API Keys:
   - Store SendGrid API key securely
   - Consider using environment variables instead of config file
   - Never commit API keys to the repository

2. File Permissions:
   - Ensure script has appropriate execute permissions
   - Protect config.cfg file with restricted read permissions

## Troubleshooting

1. Path Issues:
   - Ensure all paths use forward slashes (/)
   - Use absolute paths
   - Verify directory permissions

2. Git Issues:
   - Ensure repository is properly initialized
   - Verify remote repository access
   - Check git credentials are configured

3. Email Notification Issues:
   - Verify SendGrid API key is valid
   - Check email addresses are correctly formatted
   - Ensure internet connectivity
